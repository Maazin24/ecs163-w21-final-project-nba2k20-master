3/10/2021 Version 1.1:
We finished 2 graphs in this version. First, the scatterplot with total ratings on the x axis and
total spending on the y axis, with each dot representing one of the 30 NBA teams and an additional 
dot representing all the free agents. The user is able to select the team on the scatterplot, which then
directs the user to the second graph - the bar chart. 

The bar chart shows the rating of each player in the selected team. We have the name of the players on the 
x axis and their ratings on the y axis.
